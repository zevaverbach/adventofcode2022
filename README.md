This was a fork of Anthony Sottile's excellent [2015 AoC repo](https://github.com/anthonywritescode/aoc2015), which I've repurposed for my own workflow.

Note that between day06 and day07 I ripped out `support.py`, so only on day07 will it work with the included items.

These are my submissions to Advent of Code 2022, done in Python. This is the first year I'm trying to do it every day.
